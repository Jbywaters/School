Windows 7 and newer Operating Systems require that the DirectSound feature be enabled for all Sound Output and Input paths
 The Ventrilo client has enabled all of these options for you this one time but it may require you to redirect the sound paths to the desired device
Can not transmit because the program has not successfully openned a sound input device such as a desktop or headset based microphone
 Please check your hardware configuration and any reported errors during connection
Your sound input device has started sending data again
Your sound input device has stopped sending data to the Ventrilo client
 Please verify that your sound drivers are up to date
 that you have selected the correct sound input device and that it is properly attached to your computer
 USB microphone devices can come loose and some sound cards will shutdown the input port if your microphone is not properly connected to the sound card
If you click Setup
 and then click the OK button
 the Ventrilo client will attempt to reset your sound input device
Error attempting to start Ducking support
 At the current time Ducking is officially supported on Windows 7 or newer operating systems

The requested operation was not performed because during CollectGarbage the loader determined that the object had been released
Although the audio output from the port will be routed to the same device as the given DirectSound buffer
 buffer controls such as pan and volume will not affect the output
Returned from IDirectMusicPerformance
MIDIToMusic
  and IDirectMusicPerformance
MusicToMIDI
 this indicates  that the note conversion generated a note value that is above 127
 so it has been bumped down one or more octaves to be in the proper MIDI range of 0 through 127
  Note that this is valid for MIDIToMusic
 when using play modes DMUS
PLAYMODE
FIXEDTOCHORD and DMUS
PLAYMODE
FIXEDTOKEY
 both of which store MIDI values in wMusicValue
 With MusicToMIDI
 it is valid for all play modes
 Ofcourse

Returned from IDirectMusicPerformance
MusicToMIDI
 this indicates  that no note has been calculated because the music value has the note  at a position higher than the top note of the chord
 This applies only to DMUS
PLAYMODE
NORMALCHORD play mode
 This success code indicates that the caller should not do anything with the note
 It is not meant to be played against this chord
Returned from IDirectMusicGraph
StampPMsg
 this indicates that the PMsg is already stamped with the last tool in the graph
 The returned PMsg
s tool pointer is now NULL
Returned string has been truncated to fit the buffer size
Return value from IDirectMusicTrack
Play
 which indicates to the segment that the track has no more data after mtEnd
Return value from IDirectMusicTool
ProcessPMsg
 which indicates to the performance that it should free the PMsg automatically
Return value from IDirectMusicTool
ProcessPMsg
 which indicates to the performance that it should cue the PMsg again automatically
Half duplex
Pending
The call succeeded
 but we had to substitute the 3D algorithm
The object could only load partially
 This can happen if some components are not registered properly
 such as embedded tracks and tools
 This can also happen if some content is missing
 For example
 if a segment uses a DLS collection that is not in the loader
s current search directory
Return value from IDirectMusicBand
Download
 which indicates that some of the instruments safely downloaded
 but others failed
 This usually occurs when some instruments are on PChannels not supported by the performance or port
Full duplex
The seek into the movie was not frame accurate
The audio stream did not contain sufficient information to determine the contents of each channel
The current title was not a sequential set of chapters 
 and the returned timing information might not be continuous
There was no preview pin available
 so the capture pin output is being split to provide both capture and preview
The stop time for the sample was not set
The graph can
t be cued because of lack of or corrupt data
The stream has been turned off
This success code is reserved for internal purposes within ActiveMovie
The value returned had to be estimated
  It
s accuracy can not be guaranteed
Cannot play back the video stream
 format 
RPZA
 is not supported
Cannot play back the audio stream
 no audio hardware is available
Cannot play back the video stream
 no suitable decompressor could be found
A connection could not be made with the media type in the persistent graph
 but has been made with a negotiated media type
The resource specified is no longer needed
Some connections have failed and have been deferred
The file contained some property settings that were not used
Some of the streams in this movie are in an unsupported format
The state transition has not completed
An attempt to add a filter with a duplicate name succeeded with a modified name
The end of the list has been reached
The system cannot find the drive specified
An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format
The environment is incorrect
The storage control block address is invalid
Not enough storage is available to process this command
The handle is invalid
Access is denied
The system cannot open the file
The system cannot find the path specified
The system cannot find the file specified
Call successful
 but returned FALSE
The function completed successfully
The file does not contain a valid container object
Attempt was made to create an audiopath that sends to a global effects buffer which did not exist
Invalid data was found in a RIFF file chunk
Attempt was made to play segment in audiopath mode and there was no audiopath
An audiopath could not be used for playback because it lacked port assignments
An audiopath failed to create because a requested buffer could not be created
An audiopath is inactive
 perhaps because closedown was called
A segment or song was asked for its embedded audio path configuration
 but there isn
t any
This is the inverse of the previous error
 The Performance has set up some audio paths
 which makes is incompatible with the calls to allocate pchannels
 etc
The Performance has set up some PChannels using the AssignPChannel command
 which makes it not capable of supporting audio paths
A script routine written in AudioVBScript failed because a function outside of a script failed to complete
 For example
 a call to PlaySegment that fails to play because of low memory would return this error
A script routine written in AudioVBScript failed because an invalid operation occurred
  For example
 adding the number 3 to a segment object would produce this error
  So would attempting to call a routine that doesn
t exist
A script written in AudioVBScript could not be read because it contained a statement that is not allowed by the AudioVBScript language
The file contains an invalid parameter control track
The file contains an invalid lyrics track
